          Bio
        </h3>
        <p>
      	I am lucky enough to have lived all over the world.  I come from England, but grew up in South Africa.  Recently I spent a number of winter seasons living and skiing in New Zealand before I came to the States.

        I started learning my first instrument when I was 6,  but it wasn't until my early teens that I started tinkering on the piano. The first piece I ever learned was a ragtime no: The Entertainer from the movie The Sting.  Not only was it upbeat and fun to play, but gave me a great sense of achievement.  After that I was hooked.  I learned piano all the way through to University level, where I studied music history, theory (written music) and performance.  Here I was taught to play and accompany others at a high level.  I then went on to study music education at postgraduate level, where I learned about music education techniques and different learning styles.
